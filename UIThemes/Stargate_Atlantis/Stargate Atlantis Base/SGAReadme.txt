This desktop theme is based on the Sci-Fi series, "Stargate: Atlantis". It contains a wallpaper (1024 x 768, set to fit screen) with theme file, icons, cursors (regular & animated), startup & shutdown screens, webviews, sounds and a color scheme.

The theme was created with Desktop Architect and zipped using WinZip 8.0. It should be extracted into "C:/". The files will end up in "C:/Program Files/Plus/Themes/". Then it should be accessible to Desktop Architect or Microsoft Plus (depending on which you use).

Also, included is a extracting application in Stargate Atlantis Base folder which contains a screensaver program. By double-clicking this, it will extract and install the screensaver "Stargate Atlantis Rising" into your system folder.

I hope you enjoy this theme as much as I had making it. Happy viewing and adventure is just a galaxy away.
